# How to Run Project

This creates a map that shows all the locations that I visited while I was in Japan.  In order to use the map you can do one of two things.

Two API's are used in this. The first is a weather API that pulls weather information from the each location. The second is google streetview which is what is used to pull the image for the picture's information box.

1. Click on a marker to learn more about it.
2. Click on the item from the menu to bring up more information about it.

On top of that you can filter the items on the left. That will remove all markers from the map except the ones that match what you typed in. 

## Known Bug

If Korea looks unstyled to you that is because, due to a healthy fear of North Korea having access to an api for maps in Korea, they have decided to opt out of many Google API features including the one that styles the map. So this is isn't really a bug and won't be fixed anytime in the future. You are just going to have to
get past it.
